###What is this

The DynamixBridge is an Android application that provides high level contextual data, generated on Android devices using the context framework Ambient Dynamix, via Internet Protocols to the other devices. It transforms the phone, and other ambient sensors which can be connected to the phone, into IoT (Internet of Things) devices, allowing access to the data from otherwise unreachable devices. The DynamixBridge supports CoaP and HTTP and will, in future releases also provide an atom-RSS Feed.

Contextual data is generated using the Ambient Dynamix-Framework, which provides this data in the form of context events. Context events are generated by plug-ins written by domain experts that can be installed into the framework on demand during runtime. Such plug-ins can provide information on the contextual state of a users surroundings or his activity to applications on the mobile phone. There are currently a host of plug-ins available, providing data on light-level, noise, recognizing spoken words or music playing in the background. Plug-ins may also control ambient actuators. You can find the official list of plug-ins on the Ambient Dynamix website. Dynamix-Plug-ins can, among other things, turn a phone into a sensor platform, providing data to installed applications or websites opened in the mobile browser. However, all this contextual data could only be used locally (in Apps and Websites) on the phone. The DynamixBridge offers a generic way to expose user-selected data-types, acquired via Ambient Dynamix, via Internet protocols with little or no configuration. The DynamixBridge does not send the data to specific receivers but runs a set of servers, making the data available. Thus the system is not depended on certain services on the web remaining active. In addition the DynamixBridge uses standards and protocols already supported by most devices, allowing for access to data with minimal effort.
